# Victor Qiu's Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! 


# [PES-Player-Rating](https://github.com/victorqqqqq/pes-player-rating)
In this project, I am inspired by my passion about soccer. I would love to see how a soccer game gives players overall rating based on 
other factors. Therefore, in this project, I will perform an analysis on how PES rates a player.

# [Indeed-Job-Search](https://github.com/victorqqqqq/indeed-job-search)
In this project, I am inspired by my summer internship research. As I used popular job-search websites, I found the results are different
between using filters or directly typing the same thing on the search bar. Therefore, I want to perform a project on finding a comparatively
efficient way to search jobs.

# [ITP 449 EDA Project](https://github.com/victorqqqqq/ITP449_EDA)
In this project, I will analyze the crime data from two perspectives: tourists and residents. At the end, we will have some suggestions for 
tourisms who plan to travel Chicago and some advice for future residents who are going to move to Chicago.

# [ITP 449 Final Project](https://github.com/victorqqqqq/itp449_final)
Marketing is making use of data analytics more frequently. I am taking a marketing class this semester, and I realized that marketing analytics is a growing area that still has a lot of potential. In this project, I will take a look at the Dummy Marketing and Sales Data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/harrimansaragih/dummy-advertising-and-sales-data).
I will perform analysis on the correlations between marketing budgets and the sales revenue, and build up a model for predicting the sales revenue using those factors.
